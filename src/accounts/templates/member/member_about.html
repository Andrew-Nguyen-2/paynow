            PayNow is an online payment system that allows organizations
            to easily pay their membership dues. It can be used by organizations
            to handle their monetary needs. It has two different user statuses:
            administrator and member. The administrator is able to send
            invoices to the members and budget the expected amount as well as
            the current amount. The website features visual aids to see how
            much of the total is going to different needs of the administratorâ€™s
            choosing and how much each member has paid of the total amount owed.

            My name is Andrew Nguyen, and I am a student at Christopher Newport University.
            I am majoring in Computer Science, and I am creating this website for my capstone
            project.  I wanted to create this service because many organizations require its
            members to pay dues which my website streamlines for them and keeps the members
            informed about the organization's funds.

                PayNow is an online payment system that allows organizations
                to easily pay their membership dues. It can be used by organizations
                to handle their monetary needs. It has two different user statuses:
                administrator and member. The administrator is able to send
                invoices to the members and budget the expected amount as well as
                the current amount. The website features visual aids to see how
                much of the total is going to different needs of the administratorâ€™s
                choosing and how much each member has paid of the total amount owed.

                My name is Andrew Nguyen, and I am a student at Christopher Newport University.
                I am majoring in Computer Science, and I am creating this website for my capstone
                project.  I wanted to create this service because many organizations require its
                members to pay dues which my website streamlines for them and keeps the members
                informed about the organization's funds.
